# FP_Growth
Mini project in "Topics in Bioinformatics"
Implementation of FP-Growth algorithm (using FP-Tree data structure).
Using the algorithm to identify frequent patterns between 2 habitat of bacteria (Fresh water and marine)
The algorithm is based on the artical "Discriminative Frequent Pattern Analysis for Effective Classification" by Hong Cheng† Xifeng Yan‡ Jiawei Han† Chih-Wei Hsu†
